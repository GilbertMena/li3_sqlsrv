Modified version of the li3_sqlsrv library from (https://github.com/jperras/li3_sqlsrv),
which allows usage of ODBC through PDO much like the MySQL data source.

Needs further testing and includes a special method which is being used to call stored procedures and bypasses the normal 
convention to return an associative array.
